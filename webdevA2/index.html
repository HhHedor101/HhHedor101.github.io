            War is something that humanity has waged for all of its existence. It is during war that people
            would want
            to
            find the most efficient
            way of prematurely ending their enemies' lives, resulting in some interesting innovations. One of
            these
            innovations is the concept of
            <b>"Armoured Fighting Vehicles"</b>, which came about in the middle of the period of <i>industrial
                warfare</i>.

            </header>
            <p>
                The term <i>industrial warfare</i> refers to a period of time that began around the same the
                time the
                Industrial Revolution began,
                and ends around the beginning of the Atomic Age (marked by the detonation of the first prototype
                nuclear
                bomb during the Trinity test).
            </p>
            <p>
                It got its name from the fact that countries began having the ability to equip their armed
                forces, by
                using
                the extreme efficiency of factories
                to rapidly produce munitions. Tanks are one example of this, as they too were, and still are,
                produced
                in
                very large quantities.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            As technology progresses and militaries find new ways of waging war, armoured fighting vehicles have
            also
            evolved greatly with their continued
            use in conflicts today - let's look into how this evolution has taken place!

                <h2>Early Conceptions</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The idea to have some sort of fortified moving vehicle be used in war is a concept that has
                actually
                existed
                for hundred of years -
                All the way back in the 15th Century, Leonardo Da Vinci (yes, the painter) was credited with
                designing
                something that is very identical
                in function to a tank.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Da Vinci's idea of a vehicle that functions much like a tank does.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                People only really started taking the idea seriously when the Industrial Revolution began, which
                was
                when
                internal combustion engines
                became a big thing - the notion of a big metal vehicle that was armed was suddenly plausible.
                Ideas were
                especially abundant in the lead-up
                to the First World War, with design proposals floating all over Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first physical functioning design was the <i>Lipták harckocsi</i>, or simply the Liptak tank
                - a
                Hungarian tracked vehicle by a guy
                called Pál Lipták. His design unfortunately was rejected by the Hungarian military as they
                deemed it too
                unprotected to be used practically.

            <p>
                Even with its centuries-long origins, tanks really only began to manifest during the Great War.
                The
                First
                World War was a conflict that was especially grim and hard to swallow.
                You might have seen some photographs or other depictions of the battlefields - gruesome fields
                of dark
                brown
                mud with puddles that were sometimes more blood than water, the
                barbed wire and abandoned bodies of deceased soldiers and horses who could not be evacuated
                strewn
                around
                everywhere, and the general ruins of former housing as well.

            <p>
                The nature of trench warfare during WWI meant that soldiers on both sides were forced to charge
                headlong
                into almost certain death by gunfire. This was the unfortunate fate
                of many men during the war. Because of this, the idea of trying to develop a vehicle that could
                withstand
                conventional gunfire whilst also providing offensive capabilities
                once again became very popular. Many countries involved in the war (France, Great Britain, the
                German
                Empire, the Russian Empire etc.) tried pioneering their own designs
                of the first warships-on-land - the <i>'Landship'</i>.
            </p>
            <aside>
                <header class="asidetitle">
                    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The term 'tank' came from a code word! The idea of landships was kept as a secret on the
                    British
                    side,
                    so developers decided to call their prototype 'water carriers' - disguising
                    the armoured vehicles as simply vehicles to transport water, so that their developments
                    remained a
                    secret from the enemy. The code word of 'water tank' was used throughout
                    development, and eventually it stuck as a way to continue deceiving the opposing Germans as
                    to their
                    true purpose.
                </p>
            </aside>
            <p>
                After a long period of development, the British finally introduced their first working tanks to
                the
                battlefield - In September 1916, a few new 'Mark I' tanks saw their first action
                at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette which was part of the Somme Offensive (one of the biggest and
                deadliest
                battles in WWI). Although many broke down in the middle of their attack, beginning
                able to withstand heavy gunfire and cut through barbed wire meant that a whole third of the
                attacking
                force
                broke through no man's land. Thus began the era of armoured warfare - its birthplace
                in trenches of Northern France.

                <figcaption>The Mark I - the first tank ever fielded in battle.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The Somme had only seen a small number of Mark Is participate - the first time tanks were used
                en masse
                was
                at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, which saw more than 400 Mark IVs (an evolution of the
                earlier Mark I) go over the top. However, mechanical difficulties and German resistance caused
                half of
                all
                these tanks to be knocked out of action in one day.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although the Mark Is did not perform very well in the Somme Offensive, public reactions exploded
                -
                British
                media compared the fearsome weapons to dragons, whales and mammoths. Many articles and
                documentaries
                were made on tanks, which saw widespread viewership. Eventually other countries developed their
                own tank
                designs - French and German designs would see combat in the latter years of the war, with the
                German
                A7V eventually butting heads with the Mark IVs at the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, the
                first
                ever
                tank-on-tank battle. At some points, successful German attacks even allowed them to capture some
                British tanks and turn them on their former masters.

                </header>
                <p>
                    Being a totally new concept meant countries got more creative with their designs. As we have
                    seen,
                    the
                    Mark Is had the layout of having the driver (the driving compartment) be placed at the
                    front, with
                    guns
                    (the fighting compartment) placed at the sides of tanks, and finally the engine compartment
                    at the
                    back.
                    Other countries tried to vary this design - such as putting the fighting compartment at the
                    front
                    of the tank instead, as seen with the German A7V or the French <i>'Saint-Chamond'</i>. Some
                    came up
                    with
                    very... <i>interesting</i> designs, like the Russian Tsar Tank.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, it could be said that the most impactful tank design was the French Renault FT
                    light tank,
                    which was
                    the first tank to follow the driving-fighting-engine compartment layout with the turret on
                    top
                    instead -
                    This is the layout tanks follow to this day.

            <p>
                In the years between both world wars, tank development still took place despite the time of
                relative
                peace.
                Countries' designs became more distiguishable from each other as they developed different
                doctrines for
                armoured
                warfare.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                France and Great Britain continued on with their research, and both came up with different ideas
                of how
                they
                were going to
                best make use of their newly-pioneered inventions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Great Britain</b> started by improving on their Great War designs, making their tanks move
                faster and
                giving
                them greater traversal
                with tanks like the Vickers Medium Mark II. British experiments eventually came up with three
                main types
                of
                main tanks - 'Light',
                'Cruiser' and 'Infantry', each fulfilling their own roles such as providing fast-moving
                destructive
                capability or acting as shields
                for regular infantry.

                <b>France</b> had a somewhat similar system, although calling their two tank types 'Infantry'
                and
                'Cavalry'
                tanks
                instead. They developed many
                unique designs and was actually the second largest producer of tanks - behind the Soviet Union.
                By the
                1930s, France had constructed possibly
                the best fleet of tanks at the time to arm themselves, from the two-manned, small-sized Renault
                R 35 to
                behemoths like the Char B1.

                However, French tanks often could not perform very well due to their crew size. France suffered
                a great
                loss
                in population in the First World War, which
                left their military short-staffed. As a result, tanks often had very small crew sizes (Light
                tanks often
                carried only two crewmen) which forced
                tankmen to carry a very heavy set of tasks, which no doubt tired them out and reduced their
                effectiveness.

                <b>The Soviet Union</b> also followed similar 'Light'/'Heavy' conventions - small and fast tanks
                with
                larger
                and
                more sturdy ones. Soviet heavy tanks
                during this period notably had multiple turrets on a single chassis, like the T28 or the T35.
                This was a
                design philosophy more reminiscent of
                WWI, since tanks at the time were mainly used to spearhead frontal assaults and involved
                attacking
                multiple
                enemy positions at once.

            </header>
            <p>
                When talking about tanks, it is almost impossible not to talk about tanks during the Second
                World War.
                This
                was the war that armoured warfare had truly began
                solidifying itself as an important weapon in warfare in general. Tanks became omnipresent, with
                almost
                every
                military that participated fielding their own
                vehicles in some way. They also started using them in conjunction with other elements. Many
                tanks were
                developed and fielded over the course of the 6 years - Let's cover the more significant ones.

                <h3>The Early German Panzers</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                From the very beginning of the war in September 1939, the 'panzers' (German term for tanks) of
                the
                Wehrmacht
                had been crossing the German border into Poland. These included
                the Panzer Is, Panzer IIs, Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs. The Panzer IIIs and IVs are of particular
                importance,
                as they were intended as Nazi Germany's two main tanks, each fulfilling
                anti-tank and infantry support roles respectively. However, these two types were available in
                scarce
                numbers, and Germany's tank fleet comprised of mostly the earlier and weaker
                Panzer Is and Panzer IIs instead.

            <p>
                The Panzer IVs are particularly noteworthy. They are probably one of Germany's all-around best
                designs,
                having been used from the start in 1939 all the way till the end of the war in
                Europe in May 1945. The design went through many phases in its evolution, with each phase being
                marked
                by a
                letter of the alphabet - from the earlier <i>Ausführung A</i> all the way till
                the <i>Ausführung J</i>. They were also used in every single theatre Germany was involved in -
                in France
                and
                the rest of Western Europe, the Soviet Union and North Africa.

            </header>
            <p>
                Tanks were also a major weapon used in the North Africa campaign, which ran from 1940 - 1943.
                The
                campaign
                initially saw British forces from Egypt butting heads with Italian forces from the Libyan
                colony. Of particular note is a British infantry tank called the Matilda II, with its most
                impressive
                aspect
                being its armour - in the earlier years, its thick armour plating meant it was almost (but not
                completely) invulnerable to Axis firepower! Matilda tanks of the British 7th Armoured Division
                laid
                waste to
                Italian forces in Egypt. Matilda tanks also was part of the force that saw Italian forces
                pushed all the way back to Libya - it even gained a nickname: 'Queen of the Desert'. These
                so-called
                royalty
                continued to be a pain all the way till late 1941, even after the Germans arrived to strengthen
                the opposition.

            </figure>
            <p>
                However, the Matilda's reign would not last long - as speed, essential in the rapid manoeuvre
                warfare
                practised in the deserts, was something she painfully lacked. Eventually, the German Afrika
                Korps
                brought
                over guns like their 8.8cm flak anti-aircraft gun, or the 5cm Pak 36 and 7.5cm Pak 40, which
                could knock
                out
                Matildas. Her effectiveness fizzled out, and she eventually reached the end of her service life
                around
                late
                1942 when designs like the 'Valentine' or 'Churchill' tanks took her place instead.

                <h3>The T-34</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The Soviet T-34 might be one of the most legendary tanks of all-time, it was superior in many
                aspects -
                it's
                76.2mm gun was superior to many other tank guns at the time and its sloped armour provided solid
                protection.
                It was produced in great numbers, being the most produced tank of WWII and influencing tank
                design for
                many
                years. It has one of the longest service lives for a tank, with some tanks still being in
                service with
                countries' militaries today.

            </figure>
            <p>
                On top of it being one best all-around tanks for its time, it was also produced in extremely
                large
                numbers -
                with more than 80,000 T-34 tanks of all variants being built. Because of the urgency of having
                to defend
                themselves, Soviet factories would often skip producing certain parts deemed unnecessary, like
                headlights.
                There were times when factories were so close to the frontlines that crews could literally drive
                fresh
                T-34s
                from the factory to the battlefields without transportation, often without their regular
                paintjobs.
                During
                the German invasion of the Soviet Union, when encountering Soviet T-34 squads, German armoured
                units
                would
                often find themselves outnumbered by T-34s.

            <p>
                It's advantages in firepower, protection and numbers made it a force to be truly reckoned with
                at the
                Eastern Front.

                <h3>The M4 Sherman</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The Allies' other Jack-of-all-Trades tank is the M4 Sherman, named after American Civil War
                general
                William
                Tecumseh Sherman - think of it as the American alternative to the T-34. In terms of individual
                performance,
                The Sherman was actually weaker than the T-34, sporting a smaller gun and lesser armour.
                However, like
                the
                T-34, it was produced in very big quantities, with almost 50,000 being produced. It went through
                many
                iterations, and saw combat in almost every theatre in WWII - France, the Soviet Union, North
                Africa and
                even
                against the Imperial Japanese.

                <figcaption>Shermans often worked closely together with infantry.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The Sherman might not have been very great on its own, but it had many unique strengths -
                particularly
                in
                logistics. The tank was very well liked among crews and frontline troops. The tank was large and
                spacious
                unlike the T-34 which was extremely cramped, and it had many entrance/exit hatches. All this
                meant crews
                were able to operate it quite comfortably, and could also make a quick escape if the tank was
                knocked
                out or
                on fire. When an Allied Sherman DID get knocked out, crews could return to their lines and
                almost
                immediately find a replacement waiting for them. The same could be actually be said for almost
                all
                pieces of
                Western Allied equipment - such was the almost phenomenal logistics system the Allies had in
                place.

                <h3>Late-war German Panzers</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                German tanks later on in the war are particularly notorious - most designs past 1943 had many
                influences
                (but are not direct products) from Hitler's idealistic aspirations for a 'Wunderwaffe' - he
                demanded his
                armoured force have a fleet of tanks that exaggerated firepower and protection. The most famous
                tank
                from
                this period of time is the Panzer V - otherwise known as the Tiger I. It had a reputation for
                having a
                gun
                that could knock out most Allied tanks, armour that protected against most Allied firepower and
                could
                still
                keep up with its contemporaries in mobility and speed. Other tanks, such as the Panzer VI -
                Panther and
                the
                Panzer VII - Tiger II or 'King Tiger' that had similarly superior design philosophies in
                firepower and
                protection. Although their reputation is somewhat overblown, which, to be fair, is a notion that
                has
                been
                debunked in recent years, the Allies were still right to fear the formidable tanks.

                However, almost all of them greatly suffered from similar issues stemming from Nazi Germany's
                situation
                late
                in the war. Germany's logistics system, exhausted from years of conflict, had largely depleted
                its
                resources. For example, Germany had fewer oil fields and sources of steel and synthetic fuel to
                draw
                materiel from. Additionally, the urgency of Germany's situation also meant things like crew
                training had
                to
                be extremely rushed. As such, German tanks could not perform very effectively and often ran out
                of fuel
                or
                ammunition - in a lot of cases, crews had to completely abandon their vehicles when their tank
                eventually
                broke down - a polar opposite of the Allied side's situation. Their extremely big size and
                weight also
                limited their reach, especially in remote areas like the Belgian or French countryside, or when
                bridge
                crossing was necessary. Therefore, while fearsome in theory, tanks like the Tigers or Panthers
                often had
                very poor practical effectiveness.

                    <h3>Other Axis Tanks</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    We have talked a lot about tanks from Germany, but the Axis powers also includes Imperial
                    Japan and
                    Fascist Italy - what about their tanks? When it comes to these two other powers, their tanks
                    were,
                    to be
                    blunt, not good. Both nations did own their own fleet of armoured vehicles, but they had
                    almost no
                    chance of matching up against the main Allied powers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Starting with the Japanese, their tanks were not good because they did not put much effort
                    into
                    armoured
                    warfare research. The most produced Japanese tank during WWII was a light tank called the
                    Type 95
                    'Ha-Go'. This tank was not powerful - its gun was only 37mm thick and its thickest armour is
                    12mm
                    thick,
                    which is extremely thin compared to the American armour it would realistically face in the
                    Pacific.
                    <br>However, there is a reason the Japanese did not bother developing their tanks - they did not
                    need
                    to.
                    When it came to fighting the Americans, the Japanese relied on the strengths of their
                    regular
                    infantry,
                    naval air arms and especially their navy, all of which were extremely potent in combatting
                    the
                    Americans. Tanks were not a necessity for the kind of war the Japanese were fighting against
                    the
                    Americans. Moreover, Japan's other enemies included China and the colonial forces of the
                    French and
                    the
                    British - none of which had equipment that could outmatch the force of the invading
                    Japanese.
                    Therefore,
                    it can be said that Japan did not have powerful tanks simply because ppwerful tanks were not
                    necessary -
                    tanks like the Type 95 were already sufficient.

                <p>
                    While Japan's situation was understandable, the same could not be said for Fascist Italy.
                    The M13/40
                    tank was intended to be the main tank used by the Royal Italian Army - it was actually
                    slightly more
                    powerful than the previously mentioned Japanese Type 95, with its thickest armour being 42mm
                    thick
                    and
                    its main gun being 47mm in diameter. While not bad on paper, the Italian armoured fleet
                    actually
                    mostly
                    consisted of 'tankettes' like the L3/33, which, honestly, could barely be considered a tank.
                    Furthermore, Italian tanks were seldom fit with radios, their crews received almost no
                    training, and
                    unit formations had zero cohesion with each other.

                <p>
                    This is actually a recurring theme across the Royal Italian Army during WWII. Italian
                    industry was
                    very
                    small compared to its enemies, and it had used a lot of its resources in preceding wars,
                    like during
                    its
                    conquest of Ethiopia in 1935 and its intervention in the 1936 Spanish Civil War. The
                    Under-Secretary
                    for
                    War Production claimed that Italy could not possibly be ready for a war until at least
                    October 1942,
                    yet
                    the military was rushed to war in 1940, under the command of generals who were expecting the
                    tactics
                    of
                    WWI-style trench warfare. The Royal Italian Army was, admittedly, a case of incompetent
                    planning and
                    almost non-existent logistics.

                <h2>The Cold War & Afterwards</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                After the end of WWII, tank development slowed down drastically since there was no longer the
                threat of
                world domination by a single dictatorship. But it did not stop completely, as ideologies clashed
                between
                East and West, and the Cold War began. The Western powers and the Soviet Union continued
                improving their
                tanks as they fought the many proxy wars characteristic of the Cold War, making them faster,
                harder-hitting,
                and more armoured.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A particularly notable early-Cold War tank is the Soviet T-54/55 series of tanks, conceived at
                the end
                of
                WWII and first put into service in 1947. It is actually the most-produced tank in history, with
                estimations
                indicating almost a whopping 100,000 being produced. This design of tank would and still be the
                basis
                for
                the tank fleets Russia fields to this day. Many smaller countries still use the 70-year-old
                tank,
                although
                usually with some modernizations to update the old design. The tank was exported all across the
                world,
                with
                countries in South America, the Middle East and Asia still having some in service.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Another development during the 1950s was the widespread adoption of the 'main battle tank'
                concept.
                'Main
                battle tanks' were usually derived from the medium tanks of the time, which sought to strike a
                balance
                between speed, firepower and protection. Tanks eventually reached a point where their guns could
                penetrate
                any practical level of armour. This meant that the class of tanks called 'heavy tanks' -
                intended to
                carry
                the biggest guns and thickest armour, was rendered obsolete. 'Light tanks' which had little
                firepower
                and
                armour also fell out of style as it was realized that no amount of speed could compensate for
                both the
                offset qualities. Thus militaries began standardizing their tank fleets with fewer separate tank
                designs
                in
                service at any given moment.

            <p>
                The previously mentioned T-54/55 tank was one of the Soviet Union's first main battle tanks.
                Another
                example
                of a wildly successful 'MBT' was the British Centurion, introduced in 1945 after WWII. It too
                has an
                extremely long and ongoing service life and is a popular choice of tank for export, although it
                was not
                mass-produced on the scale the T-54/55 was, having less thank 5,000 units built.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Skipping ahead to around the late 1970s, this was when the prototypes for the tanks in service
                today
                would
                be coming out. In November 1976, the US Department of Defense would award the Chrysler Defense
                company a
                $4.9B USD contract to begin producing the finalized design of the XM1, which is now known as the
                M1
                Abrams
                main battle tank - this is the tank that would be an icon of late and post-Cold War American
                interventionism, especially in the Middle East. The tank would appear a lot in Iraq and Afghanistan.

            <p>
                At around the same time in 1979, the first Leopard 2s were being pressed into service by the
                West German
                military. This tank is still in service in Germany today, being on its eight iteration - the
                'Leopard
                2A8'.
                The Leopard 2 also happens to be a very popular export design, with many other NATO nations
                procuring
                some
                of their own and modifying it to their needs. Sweden built some of their own Leopards, calling
                it the
                'Stridsvagn 122'. Poland bought some of the older 'Leopard 2A4' tanks from Germany and
                mdoernized them,
                dubbing it the 'Leopard 2PL'.

                <h2>The Classification of Tanks</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Throughout this whole article, you would have heard tanks being referred to as 'light tanks',
                'medium tanks'
                or 'heavy tanks' particularly in the WWII section, whilst the Cold War onwards used terms like 'main
                battle
                tank' or 'infantry fighting vehicle'. This section aims to explain all these terms!
            </p>

            <header class="segmenttitle">
                <h3>Light, Medium and Heavy Tanks</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                These are the terms that were mainly used to classify tanks before, during and a little bit after
                WWII.
                Alongside describing their weight
                and size, these types also worked to briefly describe the combat role the tank of that type would
                most
                likely be assigned;
                <br>
                <br>
                1. <b>Light tanks</b> were, as the name implies, smaller and lighter tanks that usually carried less
                armour
                and firepower, in exchange for being highly mobile. They were usually assigned less confrontational
                roles,
                like armoured reconnaissance or artillery observation. They were much more prevalent in the 1930s
                and 1940s,
                but some light tank designs did exist in the Cold War, like the American 'High-Survivability Test
                Vehicle -
                Light'.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <b>Medium tanks</b> are the middle-ground of performance aspects of tanks, balancing mobility,
                firepower
                and protection. They are usually employed as the bread-and-butter of armoured fleets, engaging in
                more
                direct combat against infantry - more well-known tanks usually fall under this category. Examples
                include
                some tanks previously mentioned in this article, like the M4 Sherman, T-34 or Panzer IV. Main battle
                tanks
                would soon succeed the medium tank in their roles.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. <b>Heavy tanks</b> are the polar opposite of light tanks, trading mobility for greater protection
                and
                firepower. Their role was to attack and destroy heavily fortified enemy positions to create openings
                for the
                infantry; They were also sometimes used as mobile bunkers. The German Tiger Is and Tiger IIs are
                considered
                heavy tanks - other examples include the Soviet KV and IS series of tanks.

                <h3>Tank Destroyers and Other Self-Propelled Weapons</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Tanks are typically designed to engage both enemy infantry and other tanks. However, there are other
                tanks
                that have more specialized qualities. <b>Tank destroyers</b>, as the name implies, is a class of
                vehicles
                intended specifically to destroy even the heaviest types of tanks. The nature of the role means
                their
                designs totally commit to firepower - they can be somewhat vulnerable to other types of attack, like
                against
                infantry or air attack. They were an almost uniquely WWII feature and typically did not typically
                have
                turrets. Tank destroyers also existed in some way during the Cold War, as vehicles that carried
                guided
                missiles instead of a conventional gun.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are also <b>self-propelled artillery</b> vehicles. While they look a lot like tanks, and are
                considered as tanks, they do not really perform like tanks. Self-propelled artillery is simply when
                designers put an artillery cannon on a tank-like chassis. They also operate much like artillery -
                positioning themselves far away from the frontlines and raining suffering down on any unfortunate
                victims.
                Having an artillery gun have its own tank body helps it reposition to a more advantageous location
                much
                quicker, and there are still self-propelled artillery vehicles being used today. Along with normal
                guns,
                this can also include rocket and missile launchers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On the other hand, there is the <b>self-propelled anti-aircraft</b> class of vehicles. Like the
                artillery
                variant, these are vehicles that carry anti-aircraft armament instead, and also include both guns
                and
                missiles. Having the ability to stay on the move means you are less of a sitting duck asking to get
                bombed.

                <h3>Infantry and Cavalry Fighting Vehicles</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The <b>infantry fighting vehicle</b> is a concept that began to grow in popularity during the Cold
                War and
                is a type still used in modern militaries. It has a role similar to Armoured Personnel Carriers - to
                carry
                troops into battle. The main difference is that IFVs actually join the troops it carries into
                combat, unlike
                APCs which have guns solely for self-defense. IFVs are also capable of engaging any ground target on
                its own
                due to the variety of weaponry the type typically carries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <i>"(An IFV is) an armoured fighting vehicle which is designed and equipped primarily to transport a
                    combat
                    infantry squad, and which is armed with an integral or organic cannon of at least 20 millimeters
                    calibre
                    and sometimes an antitank missile launcher"</i> - The 1990 Treat on Conventional Armed Forces in
                Europe,
                on the definition of an IFV.

                The term 'Cavalry Fighting Vehicle' is a term that comes from the American M3 Bradley Cavalry
                Fighting
                Vehicle. It is very similar to its older sister, the M2 IFV, also called the Bradley. It is
                different in
                that it has fewer acommodations for infantry passengers, but carries more ammunition and has a
                different
                role from the M2 (armoured reconnaissance rather than infantry support).

            <p>
                Here are some more very interesting tank-related technology and notable tanks throughout history!
            </p>

            <header class="segmenttitle">
                <h3>Antonov A-40</h3>
            </header>
            <figure style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Images/subtopics/flyingtank.jpg" alt="Soviet flying tank prototype"
                    title="Soviet flying tank prototype">
                <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The A-40 was a WWII Soviet experimental FLYING tank!
                <br>
                Not really - the idea was that a bomber carrying a Soviet T-60 light tank with biplane wings would
                drop the
                tank
                on the battlefield, so that the tank could glide to a position close to its objective. This idea was
                never
                practical though - there was a very fundamental problem in testing. In order for any plane at the
                time to be
                able to carry a tank, Soviet testers were forced to strip the tank of all of its ammunition, and
                could only
                use a tiny amount of fuel. Thus if this concept was applied, even if the glider tank did survive the
                fall
                with its crew, there was no way it could inflict any significant damage or complete any objective
                before
                running out of resources. In fact, it would most likely only cause issues, since there would then be
                a tank
                crew stuck behind enemy lines and in-need of rescuing.
                <br>
                Technology would reach a point when planes could carry even the heaviest tanks with more
                reliability. But
                hot-dropping them in combat would most likely remain impractical and unnecessary.

            </figure>
            <p>
                In WWII, Allied tanks could have 'duplex drives' that allow them to float above water. Today, tanks
                can
                actually move around underwater, simply by attaching a snorkel to the tank which provides a path of
                air
                circulation. This technique is particularly invaluable in Europe, as NATO and Soviet forces would
                encounter
                many rivers where bridges may be destroyed or otherwise inadequate for use by heavy vehicles like
                tanks.
                Crews tend to be a little nervous about this method of water-crossing, as they are physically
                trapped inside
                the tank. If a snorkelled tank broke down in the middle, the crews would have to stay inside until
                it is
                towed above water.
            </p>

            </header>

            <p>
                As weapons become more advanced, so did the protection systems on tanks. Tanks no longer need to
                rely solely
                on thicker skin to shield them from harm, as there have been recent developments of gadgets that can
                neutralize or completely destroy incoming anti-tank missiles. These 'active protection systems' have
                two
                categories - <b>'soft-kill'</b> and <b>'hard-kill'</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>'Soft-kill'</b> is a system in place to confuse or otherwise mess with an incoming missile's
                tracking - missiles are not effective if they cannot hit their target accurately. Gadgets such as
                smoke
                screens or 'dazzlers', which disrupt missile guidance with radiation, are considered soft-kill
                countermeasures.
                <br>
                <b>'Hard-kill'</b> countermeasures, on the other hand, seek a more complicated but proven method -
                physically pulverizing an incoming missile until it is dust. A simple way to think of it is that
                there is an
                automated turret on a tank that, when it sees a missile coming, tracks the missile and shoots a
                shotgun
                shell at the missile. This can prematurely detonate the missile before it comes into contact with
                the
                protected tank. It is like a miniature missile defense system for the tank.
